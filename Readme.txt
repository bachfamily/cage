===================================================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================================================

Intel-based Mac or Windows computer running Max 7.3.5 or higher and bach 0.8.1 or higher.


===================================================
HOW TO INSTALL
===================================================

You should install cage directly from the Max Package Manager.

Alternatively, you can copy the "cage" folder inside the "Packages" folder in your Max folder. The Max packages folder is under "Documents/Max 7" (for Max 7) or "Documents/Max 8" (for Max 8).

You can obtain cage from Github, at the URL https://github.com/bachfamily/cage

You also should install the bach package, also from the Max Package Manager.


===================================================
HOW TO UNINSTALL
===================================================

Uninstall from Max Package Manager, or delete the "cage" folder from the "packages" folder.


===================================================
WHERE TO START
===================================================

The patch "cage.overview" (located in the "Extras" Max's menu) contains links to all the help files of cage, as well as a number of tutorials which are probably the easiest place to start.

It is probably useful to have a grasp of the basic features of the bach library before starting using cage. You can refer to the "bach.overview" patch in the "Extras" menu, as well as the video tutorials on bach's Patreon page.


===================================================
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===================================================

This project has been conceived and developed within the framework of a research residency at the Haute École de Musique in Geneva, a branch of the HES-SO (Haute École Specialisée de la Suisse Occidentale).

cage is dedicated to the memory of Éric Daubresse, the very initiator of this project, whom we miss so much.
