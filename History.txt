v. 0.5.1

*************************
*** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***
*************************
These might break compatibility with older patches

- cage.transp			@tail attribute no longer exists. 
					Duration lines are always precessed, unless disabled via the new @dl attribute. 
					Please update your patches

- cage.extract is now cage.crop	This should not break compatibility with older patches, as cage.extract still remains as hidden alias

- cage.shift and cage.offset are merged into simply cage.offset
				cage.shift remains as hidden alias of cage.offset, but you should use cage.offset instead
				Verify your patches, since the two patches differ slightly



***********************
