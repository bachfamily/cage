		Insert time in a roll
	</digest>

	<description>
		<o>cage.spacer</o> allows inserting time in a roll.
		Note tails falling into one of such zones can be either prolonged or splitted
		according to the <m>split</m> attribute.

		<attribute name="out" get="1" set="1" type="symbol" size="1">
			<digest>
				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the followings: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed. Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

				When the <m>split</m> attribute is set to 0 (default),
				all the notes of the original rolls are left untouched. <br />
				When it is set to 1, the notes whose tails are cut
				by the split point are themselves split, with silence inserted. <br />
				When it is set to 2, the durations of the cut notes
				are augmented of the duration of the silence. <br />
				When it is set to 3, the cut notes are trimmed at the insertion point. <br />
				When it is set to 4, the cut notes are trimmed at the split point.
