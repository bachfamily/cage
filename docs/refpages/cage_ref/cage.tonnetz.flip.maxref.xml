				The coordinate of a point of the tonnetz is the position of such point in the oblique grid created by the horizontal axis, passing
				for the tonnetz center, and the diagonal axis, at 60° counterclockwise from the horizontal one, again passing for the tonnetz center.
				Coordinates above the center and at right have positive values, below and at left have negative ones. Each point can be uniquely determined
				by the amount of steps one must take rightwards from the center (coordinate 1) and diagonlly upwards at 60° (coordinate 2) in order to
				get to the point.

				Outlet Types

			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the followings: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed. Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.
